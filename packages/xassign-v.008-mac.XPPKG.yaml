Short_Description:
  Save your axis and button and even field of view assignments per aircraft.
  Have as much as 3 sets of settings per aircraft if you wish and access each with just one button or key press.
Description:
  I found myself reassigning buttons and axes once too often, so here is a solution.
  You can save and load 3 sets of assignments (buttons and axes and field of view) PER aircraft.
  NOTE axes change get recognized by X-Plane only if you visit the "Settings/Joystick/Axis" menu.
  You can bind keys or buttons to barbarossa/xassign/... to load (or initial save) the sets.
  If a set is not existent and you try to load it, it gets created instead and you can load it from now on.
