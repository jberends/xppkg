Description:
   This is the latest release (version 4.7, August 4th 2012) of the Boeing 737NG aircraft simulation by the x737project. This release brings your experience with a 737NG simulation to a new level of realism. An super detailed exterior level of detail, along with an unparalleled plugin-based 737NG simulation of important aircraft systems - especially the AFDS (automatic flight director system) and a number of available add-ons, flight planning tools and finally more than 100 liveries from all over the world are waiting for your input. Never before we have made a release of this weight, you can fill you harddisk with more than 1.0GB of x737 stuff! Again, this a good x737project tradition, the x737project team is providing the whole stuff for free.
   We strongly recommend to get the latest version of the x737FMC/UFMC add-on which is available from Javier Cortes x737FMC/UFMC website. This brings the ultimate experience for all who want a maximum of realism. The coming up x737FMC/UFMC version 2.7 and x737 version 4.7 are tuned to work together perfectly! Please refer to the x737FMC version update page for more information about the latest release.
